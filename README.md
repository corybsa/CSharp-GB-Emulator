# C# GB Emulator
A project I started back in 2016 and never finished.

I think I remember reading somewhere that C# wouldn't be a good language to write an emulator. I wanted to prove them wrong.

I got up to point where you can load a rom and it knows what game it is and everything is loaded into "RAM". I got pretty far I think and I just needed something to diplay the graphics and play sound... ok maybe I didn't get that far.
